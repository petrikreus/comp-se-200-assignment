# Introduction

> - Short introduction to the contents of the document.
> - What is in the document?
> - What is the purpose of the document?

# Scenarios

> - The descriptions of your end-to-end scenarios.
> - What components of the E-commerce store will be tested, how and why?
> - What tools will be used for the testing (if you can think of any based on the provided documentation)?
> - A (UML) diagram of your scenario. The diagram can be, for example, an activity or sequence diagram, whatever feels
    most natural. The diagram can be high-level (abstract). If you know which tools are should to be used, describe how
    they are used in relation to your diagram.
> - List the source code files you selected for your unit tests from the provided utility library. Use a prioritization
    method to validate your file selections. Remember your end-to-end scenarios.

# Tools

> - Description of the chosen tools, packages, libraries, etc. including possible links to web sources (tutorials,
    homepages, etc). Why did you select these tools and how did you test them?
> - How would the tools be used to test your end-to-end scenarios?

# Tests

> - What kind of tests are to be performed (unit, integration, â€¦), and what is their importance for the end-to-end
    scenarios you described?
> - What components of the E-commerce store will be tested and what will not be tested, and why?
> - How will the test results be documented?
> - If bugs or issues are found, how are they classified or categorized? Add a template of you bug/issue report if
    needed.
> - When the tests are considered "passed"?
> - How to guarantee adequate code coverage?

# Virtual Machine

> - Optionally, the description of your Virtual Machine setup with screenshots (e.g. of a tool test you are running), if
    you want to try your luck in getting the bonus point.

# References
